Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1!

In this mentor-led session, you will begin an exciting journey to build a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools.

Key features of the project This project will be built using MERN Stack. REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, you will learn to build scalable APIs. Authentication: You will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: You will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB. Backend Development: As a part of the project, you will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.

Core concepts covered Overview of the MERN stack :- The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application (both front-end and back-end). This streamlines development and makes it easy for newbies üê£.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Repository Creation

* Created a GitHub repository named "Ecommerce-Follow-Along" with a README file.

### Milestone 2: Initial Setup & Login Page

* Pushed code to the GitHub repository.
* Set up separate folders for frontend and backend.
* Developed a functional Login Page for the frontend.

### Milestone 3: Project Setup & Foundation

* Established project structure, set up database connection, and implemented basic error handling.

### Milestone 4: User Authentication & File Uploads

* Implemented user registration, login, and file upload functionalities.
* Integrated user authentication and authorization middleware.

### Milestone 5: User Signup

* Created the Signup page with form validation.

### Milestone 6: Password Encryption & Data Storage

1. **Encrypt Password:**
    * Hash the user's password with `bcrypt` during signup.
    * Store the hashed password securely in the database.

2. **Store User Data:**
    * Save user data (e.g., name, email) in the database, ensuring the password remains encrypted.

### Milestone 7: Login Endpoint

1. **Accept User Credentials:** Receive email/username and password from the user.
2. **Retrieve User:** Query the database for the user matching the provided credentials.
3. **Password Validation:**
    * Hash the entered password with `bcrypt`.
    * Compare the hashed password with the stored hashed password in the database.
    * Authentication is successful if they match.

### Milestone 8: Product Card & Homepage Layout

* Created a reusable Card Component with props for product details.
* Designed the Homepage layout using a grid or flexbox to display multiple product cards.
