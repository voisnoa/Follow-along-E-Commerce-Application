Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1!

In this mentor-led session, you will begin an exciting journey to build a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools.

Key features of the project This project will be built using MERN Stack. REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, you will learn to build scalable APIs. Authentication: You will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: You will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB. Backend Development: As a part of the project, you will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.

Core concepts covered Overview of the MERN stack :- The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application (both front-end and back-end). This streamlines development and makes it easy for newbies üê£.
