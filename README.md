Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1!

In this mentor-led session, you will begin an exciting journey to build a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools.

Key features of the project This project will be built using MERN Stack. REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, you will learn to build scalable APIs. Authentication: You will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: You will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB. Backend Development: As a part of the project, you will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.

Core concepts covered Overview of the MERN stack :- The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application (both front-end and back-end). This streamlines development and makes it easy for newbies üê£.

# **Milestone 31: Progress Summary**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup**

- ‚úÖ **Redux Installation**: Installed the `react-redux` npm package for global state management.
- ‚úÖ **Store Folder Creation**: Created a `store` folder in the `client` directory with `store.js` and `userActions.js` files.
- ‚úÖ **Global State Configuration**: Configured a Redux store in `store.js` with a `userReducer` to manage the user‚Äôs email state.
- ‚úÖ **Action Creator**: Defined a `setEmail` function in `userActions.js` to update the email in the global state.
- ‚úÖ **Provider Integration**: Wrapped the `App` component with the `Provider` component in `main.jsx`, passing the store as a prop.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup**

- ‚úÖ **No Changes**: Leveraged existing frontend structure without backend modifications.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Achievements**

- Successfully set up Redux to manage the user‚Äôs email as a global state, accessible across components like `OrderConfirmation`, `PaymentOptions`, and `MyOrders`.
- Established a foundation for centralized state management in the e-commerce application.

# **Milestone 32: Progress Summary**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup**
