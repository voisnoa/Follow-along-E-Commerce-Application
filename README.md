Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1!

In this mentor-led session, you will begin an exciting journey to build a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools.

Key features of the project This project will be built using MERN Stack. REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, you will learn to build scalable APIs. Authentication: You will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: You will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB. Backend Development: As a part of the project, you will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.

Core concepts covered Overview of the MERN stack :- The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application (both front-end and back-end). This streamlines development and makes it easy for newbies üê£.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Repository Creation

* Created a GitHub repository named "Ecommerce-Follow-Along" with a README file.

### Milestone 2: Initial Setup & Login Page

* Pushed code to the GitHub repository.
* Set up separate folders for frontend and backend.
* Developed a functional Login Page for the frontend.
* Set up a React app for the frontend and a Node.js server for the backend.
* Configure CSS for styling.
* Added optional extensions for improving development efficiency.
* Built a functional and styled Login Page for the frontend.

### Milestone 3: Project Setup & Foundation

* Established project structure, set up database connection, and implemented basic error handling.

### Milestone 4: User Authentication & File Uploads

* Implemented user registration, login, and file upload functionalities.
* Integrated user authentication and authorization middleware.

### Milestone 5: User Signup

* Created the Signup page with form validation.

### Milestone 6: Password Encryption & Data Storage

1. **Encrypt Password:**
    * Hash the user's password with `bcrypt` during signup.
    * Store the hashed password securely in the database.

2. **Store User Data:**
    * Save user data (e.g., name, email) in the database, ensuring the password remains encrypted.

### Milestone 7: Login Endpoint

1. **Accept User Credentials:** Receive email/username and password from the user.
2. **Retrieve User:** Query the database for the user matching the provided credentials.
3. **Password Validation:**
    * Hash the entered password with `bcrypt`.
    * Compare the hashed password with the stored hashed password in the database.
    * Authentication is successful if they match.

### Milestone 8: Product Card & Homepage Layout

* Created a reusable Card Component with props for product details.

* Designed the Homepage layout using a grid or flexbox to display multiple product cards.

### Milestone 9: Product Form Creation

1. **Create Product Form:**
   - Make a form for adding product details like name, description, price, and images.

2. **Image Uploads:**
   - Allow users to upload multiple images for the product.

3. **Form Validation:**
   - Check that the form fields are filled correctly (e.g., price is a number, name is not empty).

### Milestone 10: Product Schema & Endpoint

1. **Product Schema:**
   - Define product details (name, description, price, image URL) using Mongoose with validation.

2. **Endpoint Creation:**
   - Create a POST endpoint to save product data to MongoDB.

3. **Why Validation?**
   - Ensures only valid data is saved, keeping the database accurate.

### Milestone 11: Data Fetching and Display

This milestone focuses on fetching product data from the backend and dynamically displaying it on the frontend using product cards.

**Key Objectives**

* Implement a backend endpoint to retrieve all product data from MongoDB and send it to the frontend.

* Create a frontend function to fetch the product data from the endpoint.

* Dynamically render the retrieved product data using the existing product card component.

### Milestone 12: My product Page 

This milestone focuses on creating a "my Products" page that displays only the product added by the logged-in user (identified by their email).

**Key Objectives** 

* Implement a backend endpoint that retreives products from MongoDB, filtering by the user's email address.

* Create a frontend function to fetch the filtered product from the endpoint.

* Dynamically render the retrieved product data on the "My Products" page using the existing product card component.

### Milestone 13: 

This milestone focuses on adding the ability to edit uploaded products, allowing users to update product details directly from the Products page.

**Key Objective**

* Add a edit button on each product card on the product page.

* implement a backend endpoint to update product details in mongoDB.

* Ensure changes are reflected on the front end.


### Milestone 14: 

Implemented product deletion: backend endpoint to delete products by ID and frontend "Delete" button functionality.

**Key Objectives**

* Added a delete button in the front and implemented its functionality 

* Implemented an endpoint to delete the products by their ID.

### Milestone 15: 

This milestone focuses on creating a reusable navigation bar, ensuring seamless navigation across different pages in the application.

**Key Objectives**

* Create a Navbar Component: Develop a separate Nav.jsx component.

* Integrate Navbar Across Pages: Use the Nav component in the main layout for consistent navigation.

* Improve User Experience: Enhance the UI with styling to make the navbar modern and easy to use.

### Milestone 17 :

This milestone is to write the cart schema to store products and to create an endpoint to store receive and store product details in cart.

**Key Objectives**

* Created a schema model for cart products.

* Implemented an endpoint for store recieve and storing product details in a cart
